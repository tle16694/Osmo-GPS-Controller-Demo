# OPEN SOURCE NOTICES (Guidance)

This project is a productized adaptation of DJI's demo repository and depends on Espressif's ESP‑IDF.

## What to Do When Shipping a Product
- Include the upstream `LICENSE` file(s) with your product distribution (documentation/website/app/package as appropriate).
- If you distribute firmware binaries, include required "notices" and attribution per each license.
- Keep a record of the ESP‑IDF version used (e.g., v5.5) and any additional components/libraries for traceability.

## Common Licenses in This Stack (Examples)
- Demo code in this repository: MIT (see `LICENSE`)
- ESP‑IDF: Apache 2.0 (and may include additional component licenses)

## Cautions
- Do not remove copyright/license notices required by the upstream license(s).
- If you add third‑party libraries, include their license and notices per their terms.
